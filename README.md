# data-sets
Here we can collect and share our EEG data-sets. We can also add to the list below of externally collected data sets. <br>
Preferrably, EEG data sets will be upload in [BIDS format](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0104-8).

### HBN Biobank (n = 664 - 10000, ages 5-21, New York)
The HBN Biobank houses data about psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle phenotypes, as well as multimodal brain imaging (resting and naturalistic viewing fMRI, diffusion MRI, morphometric MRI), **electroencephalography**, eye-tracking, voice and video recordings, genetics and actigraphy.

### Max Planck LEMON (n = 228, ages 20-77, Leipzig)
MRI at 3 Tesla (resting-state fMRI, quantitative T1 (MP2RAGE), T2-weighted, FLAIR, SWI/QSM, DWI) and a **62-channel EEG experiment at rest**. During task-free resting-state fMRI, cardiovascular measures (blood pressure, heart rate, pulse, respiration) were continuously acquired. Anthropometrics, blood samples, and urine drug tests were obtained. Psychiatric symptoms were identified with Standardized Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID-I), Hamilton Depression Scale, and Borderline Symptoms List. Psychological assessment comprised 6 cognitive tests as well as 21 questionnaires related to emotional behavior, personality traits and tendencies, eating behavior, and addictive behavior.
